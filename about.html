      <h1 id="aboutTitle">Mississauga needs more trash cans</h1>
      <div id="aboutMain">
        <p>According to the councillor's, Mississauga needs more trash cans to help combat the problem at hand</p>
        <p>First key point: According to councilors “ shortage of garbage cans and recycling bins in parks across the city is leading to some big messes.” If this is the case, then building more would prevent this. 
        </p>
        <p>Second key point: perhaps factors like the fact there's no close garbage cans, and the fact that every can is full may lead people to want to litter instead of throwing it away. If this is the case, more trash cans certainly would help the problem. 
        </p>
        <p>Third Key point: According to Carolyn Parrish there is (2022) “lack of trash bins in parks seems to be a problem not only in her ward, but throughout Mississauga(p.1).” This may be leading to the problem of garbage disposal in Mississauga as well. 
        </p>
        <p>Fourth key point: Another thing parrish stated was that (2022) “garbage cans and recycle bins need to be placed in pairs at parks, and in appropriate numbers to handle the demand.(p.1)” Recycling things like plastics, styrofoam, etc have also been brought up so this may also help demands. 
        </p>
        <p>Fifth key point: In addition city clean up crew, and workers also stated a (2022) “dramatic increase in the amount of litter since the start of the COVID-19(p.1)“ If this is the case, then parrish’s ideas to add more garbage cans would work
        </p>
        <p>To finalize, the last article does make sense as to why it's related to the original topic. The original pitch that talks about keeping Mississauga in a much cleaner, and integral way. If more garbage cans are installed, perhaps this may also decrease the amount of littering that is reported. There are a few questions that come up with this. Earlier it was stated that landfills are being overfilled, and can’t keep up with right now's demand, so how would this stack up? Another question is whether some people would even use the cans if they’re already so used to littering anywhere they want instead.
