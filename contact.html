      <h1 id="aboutTitle">garbage workers striking from their Job's</h1>
      <div id="aboutMain">
        <p>There has been a few times where garbage workers strike from their job, which may lead to more problems resulting cleanliness as well</p>
        <p>First Key Point: Garbage workers strike, which may cause delays in the pickup of garbage from their houses. According to Ryan Rocca (2021) “delays in the collection of garbage and organics, while recycling and yard waste will not be picked up during the labour disruption, region officials say.(p.1)” 
        </p>
        <p>Second Key point: If the workers who are supposed to help narrow down the garbage in peoples houses, and stop it from overflowing strike more problems are caused. The City website says to (2021) “Please leave garbage and organics at the curb until further notice (even on the weekend),(p.1)” The problem here is, whether the garbage may start overflowing leading to more accidental littering 
        </p>
        <p>Third Key Point: Aside from the fact that during these strikes garbage won't be picked up; in the same boat recycling also won’t be picked up. Though according to Rocca during these times of strike “Organics will only be picked up on garbage collection weeks.(p.1)”
        </p>
        <p>Fourth Key Point: These workers usually strike very rarely, and only do so when they feel their work isn’t being met. According to the Emterra Environmental Services (2021) ““By far the largest issue right now is the discrepancy in wages(p.1)”
        </p>
        <p>Fifth Key Point: The city tried to reason with people who felt cheated out of the services they use tax paying money to achieve, but the city says to “appreciate that we are just trying to get fairness.(p.1)”
        </p>
        <p>This one may seem even further front he original pitch from the last one, but it still has some great topics that can be related to the cleanliness, and integrity of communities. Firstly, if garbage cans overflow as a result of the strike, would that perchance cause some sort of accidental littering where trash blows away? Another question that can be asked from this sense is whether the city actually cares about keeping it clean? If they are able to let workers who are the main part of cleaning the streets strike, how much do they really care for the cleanliness of the city?
