      <h1 id="aboutTitle">Why littering is such a big issue in Mississauga communities</h1>
      <div id="aboutMain">
        <p>The first problem with community areas in Mississauga talked about will be littering/trash abuse</p>
        <p>First Key Point: Littering is a huge issue that affects the integrity of Mississauga communities. According to Mississauga officials “Littering impacts everyone in our city, including the animals we share it with,”(p.1)</p>
        <p>Second Key Point:  It seems that littering is an already very well known issue, and the government is already trying to combat it. They have done so by trying to make phone lines, enforce more rules, and show residents the effect littering has on community areas, and parks.</p>
        <p>Third Key Point: The four most common foods that were thrown away according to the city of Mississauga were “plastic bottles, coffee cups, cigarette butts and fast-food remnants “. </p>
        <p>Fourth Key Point: The city of Mississauga has actually issued various phone numbers so people can call if they see trash in places where it should not be. According to the city (2022) “spotting garbage and debris in a Mississauga park or on a trail, or on private property, is asked to call the City’s 311 line to report it(p.1)”. The city has even made one for highways/ramps garbage pickup “To report trash and debris on the 400 series highways or ramps, call the Ministry of Transportation at 1-800-268-4686.”</p>
        <p>Fifth Key Point: Another interesting fact to think about, is why littering always affects communities the most in winter? Supposedly, according to Mississauga officials (2022) “Mississauga parks staff have dealt with a significant litter problem since early spring of this year, when melting snow revealed tonnes of discarded trash(p.1)”. Tonnes is a lot of trash, which would make sense. </p>
        <p>Now, considering my pitch is going over the integrity, and cleanliness of Mississauga parks and communities. A part of that would be trying to keep all of these areas clean. If there are supposedly Tonnes of trash according to Mississauga officials; this is already one huge issue considering a clean community is an integral one. Though, there are a few questions that come up in accordance with above research. Firstly, why are those four so mainly prevalent in throwing away, considering there are specific areas made for them in some cases. Next, how come so much garbage all of a sudden appears in winter; and how exactly does said garbage get into the snow? </p>
