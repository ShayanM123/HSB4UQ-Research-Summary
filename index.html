        <p>Main Pitch: Community areas, and park cleanliness/integrity</p>
        <p>
            There are many people out there trying to change something they feel is not up to the standard it should. Some may see the school system, safety of communities, work and housing, etc. The main topic this paper will be going over is community areas, and park cleanliness. It is no secret that there are negative things anywhere you go, but there should be something done to try and help the surrounding good people. For example, when going to a park that is mainly for kids and families; you may see people smoking, littering, or indulging in improper disposal activities which endangers the integrity of said area. In the same boat, in these surrounding areas in the community; many shady things happen which give people a negative output in their community areas . This should not be the case, and many people agree with the same motives.
            </p>
            <p>Now that said information above has been shown, going back to the main topic of community areas, and park cleanliness. There seem to have been laws that directly changed with the change of time; this can show direct proof that parks and community areas seem to be becoming less integrable. The city of Mississauga issued more laws, and increased the strictness on rules that keep communities safe. A few of these would be brought forth by Mississauga officials (2020) “Smoking regulations aligned with the Region of Peel’s No Smoking or Vaping By-law which prohibit s smoking and vaping in public outdoor spaces… Designated busking areas to be identified through the City’s SaugaBusks program… Providing clear prohibition of the use of profane/abusive language, including hate speech during gatherings and events within parks”. Though this is a great start, there still seems to be uncertainty over the topic of community area and park safety.
