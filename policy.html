      <h1 id="aboutTitle">Household Products being dumped in parks/community areas</h1>
      <div id="aboutMain">
        <p>Another integral part of keeping Mississauga and community areas clean, would be to stop throwing household products in parks</p>
        <p>First Key Point: It seems that people dumping their household items in parks/community trash cans has become a big problem. According to Declan Finucane Mississauga officials they wish to (2023) “keep the lid on a worsening litter problem across the city the past few years are urging residents to keep their household garbage out of public parks and dispose of it properly.”
        </p>
        <p>Second Key point: There was an anti-litter message sent by the municipality. This letter talked about how residents needed to stop littering, as well as dispose of garbage properly; and not just dump it in community areas. 
        </p>
        <p>Third Key Point: lots of general trash ends up on the floor, even though garbage cans are right around the corner. Supposedly the problem has ramped up to such a degree that on the app “X” the city of Mississauga said (2023) “Lots to throw out? Please don’t dump household garbage at our parks or facilities.”
        </p>
        <p>Fourth Key Point: According to Nadio Pilanodo Mississaugas director of Parks stated “We are continuing litter messaging this year with calls to action specific to how people can help every day to control litter.” This is backed up by an influx of signs, roadside reminders, as well as social media posts. 
        </p>
        <p>Fifth Key Point: A new problem of personal protective equipment, and face masks have been popping up a lot; which should definitely not be littered or discarded in a community area. The issues has gotten to a degree where according to the city of Mississauga's information (2023) “coffee cups, pop cans, water bottles, pieces of Styrofoam, old drywall, fast food wrappers/containers, cigarette butts and gum have all been found piled up in ditches, parks and even hanging from trees the last couple of years.”
        </p>
        <p>Again, this relates to the initial goal of trying to keep Mississauga a cleaner place. As well as keeping the communtity and parks integrity/cleanliness. As an addition, this article also goes over a sub-problem to Mississaugas garbage, and cleanliness problem. If there are people who throw tonnes of trash, hygiene items, and household items into imprpoper areas, it would be another problem that the original main pitch/topic covers. As for questions pertaining to said article. In the comments of the "X" post, people talked about not knowing where to actually throw away their trash, so is the trash throwing process clear? Another questions thats askable is whether the process to throw away trash is tedious or not? if so, it may deter people from throwing away their trash. </p>
