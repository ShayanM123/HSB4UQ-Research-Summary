      <h1 id="aboutTitle">Urgency of the garbage crisis</h1>
      <div id="aboutMain">
        <p>This next article goes over the urgency that the garbage issue has </p>
        <p>First Key Point: New landfills can’t be made, which is causing a higher degree of urgency resulting in more of the trash problem.If new landfills, and garbage can’t be stored; more and more will pile up in community areas. 
        </p>
        <p>Second Key Point: According to Mike Chopowick (2020) “Ontarians are now sending almost 12 million tonnes of waste to landfills every year(p.1).” This is ridiculous since it's about “70 percent of the material we throw out(p.1)“ Despite efforts, more and more is being sent to landfills than ever before; which ruins community areas even more. 
        </p>
        <p>Third Key Point: One saving grace here is according to Chopowick (2020) “About one-third of that garbage is trucked to landfills in the United States(p.1).” Though it isn’t a lot, it’s still something that helps the problem of community garbage, and cleanliness. 
        </p>
        <p>Fourth Key Point: Again, in accordance with what Chopowick said (2020) “ it takes at least 10 years to plan and construct a new landfill(p.1).” This would mean the area is still 120 million tonnes behind what it should be unless more are built, but the issue is more can’t be built.</p>
        <p>Fifth Key Point: the forging of new bill 197 stated “creates a further barrier to waste disposal investment by requiring local municipalities to approve new landfills(p.1).” Though it’s good, it further delays the efforts of people who are trying to overcome the trash issue. 
        </p>
        <p>Now, this one may seem kind of drawn out from the first pitch, but it has a lot of correlation. Firstly, if people were to all throw out garbage; where would said garbage go? The problem of landfills, and a lack of places to dispose of garbage is very dangerous for not only the environment, but the initial pitch which is the integrity, and cleanliness of communities and parks in the Mississauga area. As for questions regarding the issue, how come new landfills can’t be made? Also, would it even make a difference if new landfills were made since littering is another initial problem?
